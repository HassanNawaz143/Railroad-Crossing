# Railroad-Crossing
This repository contains a Java-based runtime system for managing and executing distributed state machines. The system is designed to support multiple state machines interacting over a network, and it includes a demonstration application for controlling gates and lights at a railroad crossing.

## Features:
Java Implementation: A Java-based solution for managing distributed state machines.
Docker Integration: Dockerfiles and Docker Compose configuration for containerizing and orchestrating state machine services.
State Machine Model: A flexible model for representing and executing state machines.
Application Example: Simulates the operation of railroad crossing gates and lights based on train detection events.
